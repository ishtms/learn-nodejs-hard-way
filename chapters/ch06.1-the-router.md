## Building the Foundation - The `Router` Class

> A small note: we will be using the camelCase naming convention for our web framework. I plan to use this framework for my personal projects and encourage others developers to use it as well. For this reason, I need to ensure that my naming conventions align perfectly with the naming conventions used in Node.js's standard library.

We'll start building the fundamental building block of any web server framework - a `Router`. A router is an utility that determines how an application responds to different HTTP requests for particular URLs or in simple terms, it determines which HTTP requests should be handled by which part of the application. 

Let's look at a normal `node:http` server, and understand why it is really cumbersome to manage different HTTP methods. Create a new project/directory, and create a new file: `index.js`

```js
// file: index.js
const http = require("node:http");

const PORT = 5255;

const server = http.createServer((req, res) => {
    res.end("Hello World");
});

server.listen(PORT, () => {
    console.log(`Server is listening at :${PORT}`);
});
```

> We talked about what every line of server does in the chapter `5.0 - HTTP Deep Dive`, but to recap: the method `res.end()` tells the server that everything in the response, including headers and body, has been sent and the server should treat the message as finished.

If you try to send a `GET`, `POST`, `PUT` request to this server using `cURL`:

```bash
curl --request POST http://localhost:5255
# Hello World

curl -X PUT http://localhost:5255
# Hello World
```

How do we identify and differentiate between different HTTP methods? Fortunately, we have `req.method`:

```js
// file: index.js

const http = require("node:http");

const PORT = 5255;

const server = http.createServer((req, res) => {
    res.end(`Hello from -> ${req.method} ${req.url}`); // Changed line
});

server.listen(PORT, () => {
    console.log(`Server is listening at :${PORT}`);
});
```

If you send a request again, using `cURL`:

```bash
curl -X PUT http://localhost:5255
# Hello from -> PUT /

curl -X PUT http://localhost:5255/hi/there/test
# Hello from -> PUT /hi/there/test
```

That should have already made you think, to write actual applications using the bare `node:http` module, there would be lot of `if` and `else` statements in our code base. You are correct. That is why we need a `Router` class that abstracts away all the functionality of handling different HTTP methods and URLs and provide a clean interface to the developer.

Before we implement our `Router` class, let's try to write a useful web server with what we have with us.

### A Toy Router

```js
// file: index.js

const http = require("node:http");

const PORT = 5255;

const server = http.createServer((request, response) => {
    const { headers, data, statusCode } = handleRequest(request);
    response.writeHead(statusCode, headers);
    response.end(data);
});

function handleRequest(request) {
    const { method, url } = request;

    let data = "";
    let statusCode = 200;
    let headers = {
        'Content-Type': 'text/plain'
    }

    if (method === "GET" && url === "/") {
        data = "Hello World!";
        headers['My-Header'] = "Hello World!";

    } else if (method === "POST" && url === "/echo") {
        statusCode = 201;
        data = "Yellow World!";
        headers['My-Header'] = "Yello World!";
    } else {
        statusCode = 404;
        data = "Not Found";
        headers['My-Header'] = "Not Found";
    }

    return { headers, data, statusCode };
}

server.listen(PORT, () => {
    console.log(`Server is listening at :${PORT}`);
});
```
Let's go through this line by line.

```js
const { method, url } = request;
```
We passed the entire `request` object as an argument to `handleRequest`, we only care about two fields: `method` and `url`. So, instead of accessing the properties like `request.method` and `request.url`, we're using destructuring to get the values of `method` and `url` from the `request` object.

```js
let headers = {
    'Content-Type': 'text/plain'
}
```
Since Node.js's `ServerResponse.end` method does not implicitly sets the `Content-Type` header, we're manually setting it - as we know we're only returning strings back to the client. It is a good practice to include all necessary headers following the HTTP guidelines.

```js
if (method === "GET" && url === "/") {
    data = "Hello World!";
    headers['My-Header'] = "Hello World!";
} else if (method === "POST" && url === "/echo") {
    ...
} else {
    ...
}
```
We are using the `data` variable to keep track of the content that will be sent back to the client. If the HTTP method is `GET` and the URL is `/` (which means the request URL on `cURL` is either `http://localhost:5255/` or `http://localhost:5255`), we will send back `Hello World!` and set our custom header `My-Header`.

The same applies to other routes as well, where we change the data being sent, the status code, and the `My-Header` header according to the `method` and the `url`. If it doesn't matches our needs, we're simply sending a `404` status code, and `Not Found` back to the client.

> Sending the right headers is really important when sending data back to the client. Headers control how the client and server communicate and protect the data. If the headers are wrong or missing, bad things can happen like security problems or the application not working. So, getting the headers right is more important than the actual data being sent.
> 
> In fact you can just ignore the data, and just send an empty response with 404 status code. Every developer knows what does a `404` code means.

```js
return { headers, data, statusCode };
```

We're returning the information back to the caller function - which in case is this part:

```js
const server = http.createServer((request, response) => {
    const { headers, data, statusCode } = handleRequest(request);
    response.writeHead(statusCode, headers);
    response.end(data);
});
```

Once the `handleRequest` function finishes executing, we get the appropriate headers, the data and the status code that needs to be sent back to the client in order to let them know "Okay we're done processing your request. Here is the result".

```js
response.writeHead(statusCode, headers);
```

`writeHead` is a method on the `ServerResponse` class, which gives us the flexibility to set response headers, as well as status code. The headers should be an object key being the header name, and value being the header value. 

But what if we do not set these headers? Turns out, if you do not set headers before `res.end()`, Node.js implicitly sets most of the headers.

> Although the second argument can also be an array with multiple entries, but we're not going to use that.

```js
res.end(data)
```

Tells the client - "I'm officially done now. Take this `data`". 

Now, let's test our simple implementation of this "router" function.

```bash
$ curl http://localhost:5255 -v    

*   Trying 127.0.0.1:5255...
* Connected to localhost (127.0.0.1) port 5255 (#0)
> GET / HTTP/1.1
> Host: localhost:5255
> User-Agent: curl/7.87.0
> Accept: */*
> 
* Mark bundle as not supporting multiuse
< HTTP/1.1 200 OK
< My-Header: Hello World!
< Date: Fri, 01 Sep 2023 14:49:06 GMT
< Connection: keep-alive
< Keep-Alive: timeout=5
< Transfer-Encoding: chunked
< 
* Connection #0 to host localhost left intact
Hello World!
```

We have our header `My-Header`, status code of `200` and the response body `Hello World!`. Let's test the `POST` endpoint too:

```bash
curl -X POST  http://localhost:5255/echo -v
*   Trying 127.0.0.1:5255...
* Connected to localhost (127.0.0.1) port 5255 (#0)
> POST /echo HTTP/1.1
> Host: localhost:5255
> User-Agent: curl/7.87.0
> Accept: */*
> 
* Mark bundle as not supporting multiuse
< HTTP/1.1 201 Created
< My-Header: Yello World!
< Date: Fri, 01 Sep 2023 14:52:33 GMT
< Connection: keep-alive
< Keep-Alive: timeout=5
< Transfer-Encoding: chunked
< 
* Connection #0 to host localhost left intact
Yellow World!%                                                                               
```

Perfect! Everything looks fine. Now it's time to test an URL or method which isn't covered by our `handleRequest` function.

```bash
*   Trying 127.0.0.1:5255...
* Connected to localhost (127.0.0.1) port 5255 (#0)
> POST /nope HTTP/1.1
> Host: localhost:5255
> User-Agent: curl/7.87.0
> Accept: */*
> 
* Mark bundle as not supporting multiuse
< HTTP/1.1 404 Not Found
< My-Header: Not Found
< Date: Fri, 01 Sep 2023 14:53:47 GMT
< Connection: keep-alive
< Keep-Alive: timeout=5
< Transfer-Encoding: chunked
< 
* Connection #0 to host localhost left intact
Not Found%      
```

Yes, the status code is `404` as expected. `My-Header` has the correct value, and the response body is `Not Found`. The implementation looks fine.

### `Transfer-Encoding: chunked`

You may have noticed a new header `Transfer-Encoding` with the value of `chunked`. What is it?

In chunked transfer encoding, the data is split into separate pieces called "chunks". These chunks are sent and received without depending on each other. Both the sender and receiver only need to focus on the chunk they are currently working on, without worrying about the rest of the data stream.

This is because, we did not specify the `Content-Length` header, and that means we **do not** know the size of the response payload, in bytes. However, one should only use `Transfer-Encoding: chunked` when you're sending a large payload and don't know about the exact size of payload.

However, there's a slight (but noticeable) performance overhead with chunked encoding when you're sending small payload to the client as chunks. In our case, we're just sending a small string `"Hello, world!"` back to the client. 

### Chunks, oh no!

The message "Hello, world!" is only 13 bytes long, so its length in hexadecimal is `D`. In fact you're only sending a simple looking string back to the client, but turns out the data being sent is almost 2x the size of the string `Hello, world!`.

Here is how it would look in chunked encoding:

```bash
D\r\n
Hello, world!\r\n
```

To indicate the end of all chunks, a zero-length chunk is sent:

```bash
0\r\n
\r\n
```

So, the full HTTP message body in chunked encoding would be:

```bash
D\r\n
Hello, world!\r\n
0\r\n
\r\n
```

Now, let's calculate the size of response with `Transfer-Encoding: chunked`:

- The size of the chunk in hexadecimal (`D`) = 1 byte
- The first CRLF (`\r\n`) after the size = 2 bytes
- The data ("Hello, world!") = 13 bytes
- The second CRLF (`\r\n`) after the data = 2 bytes
- The zero-length chunk to indicate the end (`0`) = 1 byte
- The CRLF (`\r\n`) after the zero-length chunk = 2 bytes
- The final CRLF (`\r\n`) to indicate the end of all chunks = 2 bytes

In total, it becomes `23 bytes`! You're actually sending back 2x the size of the payload, which is a lot of extra overhead. The bigger your response payload, the lesser the overhead.

But most of the text responses don't need chunked encoding. It's helpful for things which are large, and you may not know the size of the payload you're sending, like a file on AWS. Chunked encoding would be a great candidate for that.

### Specifying `Content-Length`

To get rid of `Transfer-Encoding: chunked`, we just have to specify the `Content-Length` header, with the value of the payload in bytes. 

```js
function handleRequest(request) {
    const { method, url } = request;

    let data = "";
    let statusCode = 200;
    let headers = {}

    if (method === "GET" && url === "/") {
        data = "Hello World!";
        headers['My-Header'] = "Hello World!";

    } else if (method === "POST" && url === "/echo") {
        statusCode = 201;
        data = "Yellow World!";
        headers['My-Header'] = "Yello World!";
    } else {
        statusCode = 404;
        data = "Not Found";
        headers['My-Header'] = "Not Found";
    }

    // set the content-length header to the value of length of `data` in bytes.
    headers['Content-Length'] = Buffer.byteLength(data);
    return { headers, data, statusCode };
}
```

The `Buffer` class provides a very useful helper method: `Buffer.byteLength`. If you try to make a request using `cURL`, you'll see the `Content-Length` header, and the `Transfer-Encoding: chunked` isn't there. Perfect.

```bash
curl http://localhost:5255 -v

# Omitted request output
> 
* Mark bundle as not supporting multiuse
< HTTP/1.1 200 OK
< My-Header: Hello World!
< Content-Length: 12
< Date: Fri, 01 Sep 2023 17:25:08 GMT
< Connection: keep-alive
< Keep-Alive: timeout=5
< 
* Connection #0 to host localhost left intact
Hello World!
```

## Code reusability

We are still one step away from implementing our `Router` class. Before doing so, I want to talk a little bit about code-maintainability. The current way is fine, but this will go out of hand when you're going to handle a lot of routes. We should always design our programs with scalability and reuse in mind.

Let's update our code to include a global object `routeHandlers` and update the code accordingly.

```js
// file: index.js

const http = require("node:http");

const PORT = 5255;

const server = http.createServer((request, response) => {
    const { headers, data, statusCode } = handleRequest(request);
    response.writeHead(statusCode, headers);
    response.end(data);
});

const baseHeader = {
    "Content-Type": "text/plain",
};

const routeHandlers = {
    "GET /": () => ({ statusCode: 200, data: "Hello World!", headers: { "My-Header": "Hello World!" } }),
    "POST /echo": () => ({ statusCode: 201, data: "Yellow World!", headers: { "My-Header": "Yellow World!" } }),
};

const handleRequest = ({ method, url }) => {
    const handler =
        routeHandlers[`${method} ${url}`] ||
        (() => ({ statusCode: 404, data: "Not Found", headers: { "My-Header": "Not Found" } }));

    const { statusCode, data } = handler();
    const headers = { ...baseHeader, "Content-Length": Buffer.byteLength(data) };

    return { headers, statusCode, data };
};

server.listen(PORT, () => {
    console.log(`Server is listening at :${PORT}`);
});
```

We are not going to use any of the code that we wrote in our `Router`, but I wanted to stop and take a moment to explain the importance of better design and planning ahead. As the project grows, it's easy to fall into the [**sunk cost fallacy**](https://www.verywellmind.com/what-is-sunk-cost-fallacy-7106851#:~:text=The%20sunk%20cost%20fallacy%20is,to%20see%20your%20resources%20wasted.), believing we should stick with our initial approach simply because of the time and effort already invested.
